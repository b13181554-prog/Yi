## Frequently asked questions

- ### How does user licensing work? Can I have different set of users across the application suite?


Your Zoho Mail user list will serve as the master user list across the applications in Workplace bundle. We are working on providing administrator control for defining different set of users across applications. We'll post updates when this is provisioned.

- ### How does the storage allotment in the Workplace plan work?


The storage size is based on the chosen plan and includes both Mail and WorkDrive storage.

In the Workplace Standard plan, each user gets 30 GB of email storage and 10 GB shared WorkDrive storage (100 GB shared team storage for 3-10 users in WorkDrive with an additional 10 GB for every new user).

In the Workplace Professional plan, each user gets 100 GB of email storage and 100 GB shared WorkDrive storage (1 TB shared team storage for 3-10 users in WorkDrive with an additional 100 GB for every new user).

- ### Can I mix and match two or more plans for the same organization?


Yes, you can [mix and match](https://www.zoho.com/workplace/flexible-pricing.html?src=wpfaq) Zoho Mail and Zoho Workplace plans based on the size of your organization.

- ### Is my data safe?


We’re fervent about keeping your data safe and secure. Our facilities feature stringent 24/7/365 security with video monitoring, biometric access, and advanced fire, flood, and theft monitoring systems. Our network security system employs the latest encryption and intrusion detection and prevention technologies.

- ### How long are your contracts?

- ### What advantage do I get by choosing the yearly plan?


We offer a 20% percent discount (approximate) if you choose annual billing. Also, if you're a non-profit or a charitable organization, we have special pricing for you. To know your discount, please contact us at [sales@zohocorp.com](mailto:sales@zohocorp.com). Please note that annual billing discounts may vary by region.
